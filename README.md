# Node using images with multer

Example of API RESTful using Node and multer to upload/download images.

## Getting Started

I have started learning multer with the following link:
https://www.djamware.com/post/5c98220080aca754f7a9d1f0/nodejs-expressjs-and-multer-restful-api-for-image-uploader

After that I have integrated in a basic Node project.

After downloading the project don't forget to:

```
npm install
```

And then you can use postman to test the API:

### Prerequisites

All you need is... some time and...
* Visual Studio Code.
* PostMan, for the RESTFul tests.
* NodeJS, as a possible Backend API
* More hours than you first could think of...

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The Editor used in this project
* [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) - Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
